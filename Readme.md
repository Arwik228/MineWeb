Minecraft web is a three.js engine simulating minecraft.

# New Features!
This was the first project using this library, and was done in a couple of evenings.
The functionality is very limited, maybe someone can use this as a template and extension.
Functional:

    > Four chunks of the "wasteland" biome
    > Change the background depending on the playing time
    > Flight and walking mode
    > Installing blocks and destroying
    > Selection of "inventory" blocks
    > Death when reaching 21 blocks in height

Needs to be finalized:

    > Fix control
    > Expand the game world by introducing a chunk system
    > Create a world generator in the chunk system
    > Give blocks with logic
    > Add mobs
